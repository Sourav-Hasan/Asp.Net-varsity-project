                            Healthcare service in Bangladesh for
                            a burgeoning population of 160 million is
                            inadequate and until recently a significant number
                            of people had to travel overseas for treatment resulting
                            in high costs and dislocation for the affected families and
                            foreign currency loss for the country. United group took the challenge
                            and set up a referral hospital in the country to provide international standard
                            treatment facilities in an evolving and nascent private sector industry.United Hospital
                            was conceived by a group of prominent doctors in mid 80s under the name of Continental Hospital.
                            Although some progress in the construction was made by early 90s the  dream of the initiators remained unfulfilled till 2004 when
                            United Group stepped in and took the responsibility of completing the project that had been waiting to see daylight for 16 years.on

                            sft, healthcare service provider for millions of people of Bangladesh. Since its opening and most of 2007 was devoted to building up
                            each department slowly and gradually. The year 2008 was the first full year of operation of United Hospital, in real sense. In 2009 we
                            can reasonably say that we have been able to include most
                            of the services & department that a multi-disciplinary hospital
                            should have.The departments currently functioning in the hospital
                            including Cardiology, Cardiac Surgery,  Gynaecology & Obstetrics,
                            Orthopaedic, Neonatology & Paediatrics, Internal Medicine, Gasteroentology, Nephrology, General

                            Ophthalmology to name a few. United Hospital launched comprehensive cancer care centre first time
